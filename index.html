        Bloomington is a small college town. What it lacks in size it more than makes up in culture and <br>
        events. In my time there I attended a political film viewing and documentry viewing for free in a local<br>
        bar. I also visited the University and ate at some fantastic restaurants. The town is very hip due to <br>
        its college aged population.

        Chicago is with out a doubt one of my favorite cities in the whole world. It's full of big city appeal <br>
    while also having many hidden jem neighborhoods spead out through out all of the area. It's a great mix of <br>
    culture, touresty stuff and beautiful architecture. It's hard to choose specific areas but for me Logan square, pilsen and Downtown<br>
    are essentials and must hit areas. Don't miss out on Antique Taco, Emporium arcade bar, Fields museum, and the art institute!

        Seattle is a very special city, It's unlike most larger cities. It got all the tell tale big city perks<br>
        such as great culture, night life and happenings but it just has a different vibe. It has a a fantastic outdoors market<br>
        named Pike place market where you can get anything from fresh produce to odd crafts and gadgets. The weather for the most part<br>
        as expected, overcast and rainy but I expierienced a few sunny days so it's not all gloom. Also the city includes a front row seat<br>
        to mt rainier, a large still very active volcano. Plus starbucks, if you're into that sort of thing.

    <br>
    <p class = 'text_change'>
        Eugene is unlike any other place on this list because it's not really known for anything in particular.<br>
        What I enjoyed about it was its small town feel, community and all around beautiful landscape. Like most of Oregon<br>
        it is surrounded by beautiful trees and woods. It's more of a place I'd see myself settling down in in my older age.<br>
        Also one of the perks of Oregon is no sales tax and in Eugene last I checked there was no Walmart! So that alone <br>
        is fairly unique.

        The Red wood forest is without a doubt one of the most breath taking sites I have ever seen. These mamoth trees range somewhere<br>
        between 200-300 feet but always vary in size and have grown much taller. This National park is a must and I ighly recoment<br>
        camping here. It's free and there are spots overlooking the Pacific Ocean that are stunning. The weather is beautiful for hiking<br>
        in the summer months. Words cannot describe what it's like seeing one of these goliaths in person so dont skip it!

       <p class = 'text_change'>
           San Fransisco is the ultimate hip town, It has amazing weather, huge hills and a college campus<br>
           in the middle of the city. It has wonderful bars, record stores and just all around amazing food. Very friendly <br>
           commnity centers with lots of resources and things to expierience while there. While the city is pricey it is<br>
           totally one of the coolest cities in the US and the golden gate bridge is a site to behold.

       <p class = 'text_change'>
           Denver and Colorado in general is a just beautiful from start to finish. With it's breathtaking mountain ranges<br>
           to it's laid back and relax atmostphere it is with out a doubt one of the must see cities in the US.<br>
           If you enjoy the outdoors, the cold and natural beauty then Colorado is for you. Denver is a great city with <br>
           fantastic night life and happenings. Worth the drive up the mountains!
